Many companies choose them as they are a great combination of low-cost and good performance. RouterOS can be also installed on other devices such as PC.\r\n \r\nThis system can be managed by the following ways:\r\n\r\n- Telnet\r\n- SSH\r\n- Winbox (proprietary GUI of Mikrotik)\r\n- HTTP\r\n- API\r\n\r\nMany network sysadmins choose to close Telnet, SSH and HTTP ports, leaving the Winbox port open for graphical management or to another client (developed by third parties) which uses the RouterOS API port, such as applications for Android (managing routers and Hotspots) or web front-ends.\r\nAt this point, MKBRUTUS comes into play ;)\r\n\r\nBoth, Winbox and API ports uses a RouterOS proprietary protocol to \"talk\" with management clients.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that in the midst of a pentesting project, you can find the ports 8291/TCP (Winbox) and 8728/TCP (API) open and **here we have a new attack vector**.\r\n\r\nBecause the port 8291/TCP is only possible to authenticate using the Winbox tool (at least by now ;), we realized the need of develop a tool to perform dictionary-based attacks over the API port (8728/TCP), in order to allow the pentester to have another option to try to gain access.\r\n\r\n## DICTIONARY-BASED ATTACK\r\nMKBRUTUS is a tool developed in Python 3 that performs bruteforce attacks (dictionary-based) systems against RouterOS (ver. 3.x or newer) which have the 8728/TCP port open.\r\nCurrently has all the basic features of a tool to make dictionary-based attacks, but in the future we plan to incorporate other options. There are many sites from where you can download wordlists, here are some:<br>\r\nhttp://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords<br>\r\nhttp://wordlist.sourceforge.net/<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n## SCREENSHOTS\r\n\r\nMKBRUTUS options\r\n![MKBRUTUS options](http://seguridadetica.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/mkbrutus_2.png)\r\n\r\nMKBRUTUS performing an attack!\r\n![MKBRUTUS performing an attack !](http://seguridadetica.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/mkbrutus_1.png)\r\n\r\n## INSTALLATION\r\nThe project is available here in GitHub, and you can install just by typing:\r\n\r\n # git clone https://github.com/mkbrutusproject/MKBRUTUS.git\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to have Python 3.x installed in order to run this tool. It was successfully tested in KALI LINUX, previous Py3 installation (apt-get install python3).\r\n\r\n## USING EXAMPLES\r\n\r\nTesting against a box at 192.168.1.1 using dictionary rockyou.txt<br>\r\n$ python3 mkbrutus.py -t 192.168.1.1 -d rockyou.txt -u admin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesting against a box at 192.168.1.1 using dictionary rockyou.txt but the API port is running in other port<br>\r\n$ python3 mkbrutus.py -t 192.168.1.1 -d rockyou.txt -u admin -p 8787<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n## DISCLAIMER:\r\nThis tool is intended only for testing Mikrotik devices security in ethical pentest or audits process.\r\nThe authors are not responsible for any damages you use this tool.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
